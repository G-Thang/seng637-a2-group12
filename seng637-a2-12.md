# 1 Introduction

This assignment aimed to familiarise ourselves with automated unit testing. Tests were written using the Java JUnit framework. JMock was used to simulate mock objects used for running tests such as those in the Values2D class. 

We wrote JUnit tests for methods associated with the ‘DataUtilities’ and ‘Range’ classes that are part of the JFreeChart Java library. Our testing strategy and collaborative test case design approach to complete it are as follows:


# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

Since the classes and methods we are writing tests for are in the form of various JAR files, we are forced to use a black-box test-case design approach since we do not have access to the written code directly. Only the Javadoc method summaries and details were referenced to get an understanding of how each method should behave. The input parameters, data structures returned, and error throw types and conditions were also referenced here.

The types of equivalence classes that we used for the Range class testing were various Range objects having different classes of limits. For example, there could be a Range that includes Double.MAX_VALUE as one of the limits, a Range that holds normal expected values, and a Range where the lower and upper limit are the same value (i.e. range length = 0). The types of equivalence classes used for DataUtilities testing were input sets being empty, regular sized sets (eg. 3 * 3), and very large sets (e.g. 10,000 * 20,000).

Boundary value analysis was used in testing as it was assumed that the function should operate consistently between boundary limits and it’s only near the boundaries that errors might be identified. For example, in the ‘contains’ range function we tested values outside, on, and inside the lower and upper Range limits to see if the correct values were produced. 


# 3 Test cases developed

3.1 - Developed Test Cases and Outcomes

The following class methods were tested, with a brief description of the tests that were written for each of them, and how the tests relate to the different types of equivalence classes and boundary value analyses mentioned above:

3.1.1 - ‘DataUtilities’ Class Methods

calculateColumnTotal() - Gi-E

testCalculateColumnTotalWithPositiveValues() - Pass : 
successfully verifies the calculation of column totals with positive values.
This test covers the equivalence class of positive values within the columns.

 testCalculateColumnTotalWithNegativeValues() - Pass : 
confirms the correct computation of column totals with negative values.
It addresses the equivalence class of negative values within the columns.

testCalculateColumnTotalWithZeroValues() - Pass : 
validates the method's handling of columns containing zero values.
This test focuses on the equivalence class of zero values within the columns.

testCalculateColumnTotalWithNullValues2D() - Failure : 
encountered an failure, indicating an issue with handling null values within the 2D array. 
It examines scenarios where null values are present, representing a boundary condition.

calculateRowTotal() - Yaad

calculateRowTotalFirstRow - FAILED:
This tests the equivalence class where a typical row with positive numbers is tested, meeting the method's requirements. The failure of this test could indicate an issue with how the calculateRowTotal method handles the starting index of rows, potentially not accounting for the first element correctly

calculateRowTotalMiddleRow - PASSED:
This tests the equivalence class for a middle row, including a case with a zero value, adhering to the summing functionality across different rows. The test passed, confirming that the row total calculation is correct for rows other than the first and last.

calculateRowTotalLastRow - FAILED:
It tests the last row, which is a boundary case for the dataset, adhering to the requirements for complete dataset testing. This failure may suggest a problem with the method's handling of the dataset's size.

calculateRowTotalForTwoValues - FAILED:
This tests the boundary case of a row with only two values, which is important for validating the method's behaviour with minimal input. The failure here could point to a potential boundary condition issue in calculateRowTotal.

createNumberArray() - Jonathan

createNumArray_EmptyArray() →  PASSED : 
Equivalence class test to confirm that it can copy over an empty double array

createNumArray_ArrayElementCheck() → FAILED : 
Equivalence class test to confirm that it can correctly copy over the elements from a double array

createNumArray_IntegerArray() → PASSED : 
Equivalence class test to confirm that it can copy over a very large double array

createNumberArray2D() - Dillon

create2DNumArray_EmptyArray() → PASSED : 
Equivalence class test that checks that it can copy over an empty 2D double array into a 2D number array

create2DNumArray_ArrayElementColumn1Check() → PASSED : 
Equivalence class test that checks that it correctly copies over the first column of data

create2DNumArray_ArrayElementColumn2Check() → FAILED : 
Equivalence class test that checks that it correctly copies over the second column of data
The test failed, and all values that were supposed to be copied over were NULL values

create2DNumArray_IntegerArray() → PASSED : 
Check that it can copy over a very large 2D double array

getCumulativePercentages() - Andrew

cumulativePercentages_RegularDataset() → PASSED : 
Equivalence class test to confirm that it accurately calculates cumulative percentages for a regular dataset.

cumulativePercentages_ZeroValues() → PASSED : 
Equivalence class test to confirm that it handles a dataset with zero values correctly. Ensures that the method can correctly process and include zero values in the calculation of cumulative percentages without causing mathematical errors or inaccuracies.

cumulativePercentages_NegativeValues() → FAILED : 
Equivalence class test to confirm that it returns correct percentages for a dataset containing negative values. The test failed because the method did not account for negative values properly, leading to incorrect cumulative percentages. This suggests a need for improved handling of negative inputs in the cumulative percentage calculation logic.

cumulativePercentages_VeryLargeDataset() → PASSED : 
Test to ensure that it properly calculates cumulative percentages for a very large dataset. This test confirms that the method can handle large volumes of data without performance degradation or calculation errors, demonstrating its scalability.

3.1.2 ‘Range’ Class Methods

contains() - Dillon

The first 7 unit tests for this method represent equivalence tests for checking MAX range (lower bound) and regular range (upper bound), while also being boundary limit tests:

negMaxRange_LowerBound_Contains() → PASSED : 
Checks that a value at the lower MAX bound is contained in the range

negMaxRange_NegInside_Contains() → PASSED : 
Checks that a negative value within the range is contained in the range

negMaxRange_0Inside_Contains() → PASSED : 
Checks that a 0 value within the range is contained in the range

negMaxRange_PosInside_Contains() → PASSED : 
Checks that a positive value within the range is contained in the range

negMaxRange_UpperBound_Contains() → PASSED : 
Checks that a value at the upper regular bound is contained in the range

negMaxRange_UpperOutside_Contains() → PASSED : 
Checks that a value outside the upper regular bound is NOT contained in the range

negMaxRange_UpperMaxOutside_Contains() → PASSED : 
Checks that a MAX value outside the upper bound is NOT contained in the range

The last 3 unit tests for this method represent equivalence tests for 0 range (upper bound = lower bound), while also being boundary limit tests:

zeroRange_NegOutside_Contains() → PASSED : 
Checks that a negative value outside the lower and upper bound is NOT contained in the range

zeroRange_0Inside_Contains() → PASSED : 
Checks that a 0 value on the lower and upper bound is contained in the range

zeroRange_PosOutside_Contains() → PASSED : 
Checks that a positive value outside the lower and upper bound is NOT contained in the range

expand() - Jonathan

expandBothPositive() → FAILED : 
Verifies correct expansion of a range with positive bounds.

expandBothNegative() → PASSED : 
Checks handling of negative margins.

expandZeroOnOne() → FAILED : 
Ensures correct expansion of a range with zero between negative and positive bounds.

expandZeroOnBoth() → FAILED : 
Validates expansion of a range consisting solely of zero.

expandMaxAndMinValues() → FAILED : 
Confirms expansion behaviour for range spanning from smallest to largest double values.


getLength() - Yaad - TESTED EACH WITH DOUBLE AND INT, TOTAL 10 TESTS

Both Positive - PASSED:
This test covers the equivalence class where both limits are within the positive number range. The test is complete as it verifies a commonality and passes and confirms the Range behaves as expected when both limits are positive.

Both Negative - PASSED:
This test addresses the equivalence class of ranges with negative boundaries and complies with the requirements. This test is complete in the context of negative values and it passed and validated the correctness of the Range with negative boundaries.

Negative + Positive - PASSED:
This is a boundary value case and it tests the transition across zero, which is a condition in numerical ranges. The test is complete as it examines the behaviour at a critical boundary (the point of zero). This test passed and confirmed that the Range can handle boundaries on either side of zero.

0 + Positive - PASSED:
This tests the boundary value case where the range includes zero, a key part of the range functionality. This test is complete for the lower boundary condition. The test passed and validated the correct inclusion of zero in the range.

Negative + 0  - PASSED:
This tests the upper boundary case where the range ends at zero, which is a requirement for correctly handling ranges. It is complete for the upper boundary condition, but should also test the lower boundary at the minimum negative value. The test passed and verified the correct handling of zero as the upper boundary.

intersects() - Gi-E

intersectShouldNotBeInBetweenNegativeTwoAndNegativeOne() - Failure : 
Examines the boundary between two negative values, adhering to boundary value analysis.
This test covers the equivalence class of values less than -1.

intersectsShouldNotBeInBetweenOneAndOnePointOne () - Pass : 
Successfully validates a specific range, exemplifying the boundary value  
analysis approach. It represents the equivalence class of values greater than or equal to 1
and less than 1.1.

intersectsShouldBeInBetweenZeroPointFiveAndZeroPointSix () - Pass : 
Demonstrates another boundary scenario. 
It corresponds to the equivalence class of values between 0.5 and 0.6.

intersectsShouldBeInBetweenNegativeOneAndZero() - Pass : 
Passes, targeting values between -1 and 0, consistent with boundary value analysis.
This covers the equivalence class of values greater than or equal to -1 and less than 0.

Highlights an issue with negative boundary values.
This tests the equivalence class of values less than -2.

intersectsShouldNotBeInBetweenOneAndTwo() - Pass : 
Passes, verifying the boundary between positive values.
It examines the equivalence class of values greater than 1.

intersectsShouldBeAtLowerBound() - Pass : 
successfully validate boundary conditions at the lower limits. 
It focuses on the equivalence class of the lowest possible values.

intersectsShouldBeAtUpperBound() - Failure : 
Successfully validate boundary conditions at the upper limits.
It focuses on the equivalence class of the highest possible values.

intersectsShouldNotBeOutsideNegativeTwoAndTwo() - Failure : 
Flags a failure, indicating a discrepancy beyond the boundary limits.
It covers values outside the equivalence class of -2 to 2.

intersectsShouldNotBeOutsideNegativeOneAndOne() - Failure : 
Similarly encounters a failure, signifying an issue with values outside the specified range. 
This test targets values beyond the equivalence class of -1 to 1.


getLowerBound() - Andrew


Positive Lower Bound
Test Name: testPositiveLowerBound(): PASSED : 
This test ensures the method correctly returns a positive lower bound. The test passing indicates that the Range class accurately handles ranges starting with positive lower values, confirming the method's reliability for positive ranges.

Zero Lower Bound
Test Name: testZeroLowerBound(): PASSED : 
Rationale: This test verifies the method's ability to recognize and return a lower bound of 0. The pass result demonstrates the Range class's correct handling of ranges that begin at zero, validating its functionality for ranges that include zero as their starting point.

Negative Lower Bound
Test Name: testNegativeLowerBound(): PASSED : 
Rationale: This test confirms the method's accuracy in reporting negative lower bounds. The success of this test shows the Range class's effectiveness in dealing with ranges that start with negative values, ensuring the method's precision for negative ranges.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

We initially met in a group to download the JFreeUnit JAR files required for testing and to set up our respective testing projects in Eclipse. We created and ran the first sample tests included in the assignment handout to get a better understanding of the syntax for each type of test and to make sure that everyone was set up properly.

We split the 10 test sets evenly, with each group member being responsible for writing tests for 1 DataUtilities method and 1 Range method. Before breaking off individually, we decided on design criteria related to equivalence class testing and boundary value testing that was discussed above. We then individually wrote unit tests for the 2 methods we were assigned, while writing documentation for the code. Each team member chose methods based on their interest to ensure motivation and efficiency.

We learned that while setting up the projects, it was beneficial for one of us to share their screen while the others followed along. We would periodically check to see if everyone was caught up before moving on to the next section of the assignment. We met periodically to track progress and offer assistance to other group members if needed.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Throughout this assignment, we encountered several challenges:


Understanding Mock Objects: Initially, integrating mock objects for unit testing was difficult as some team members were unfamiliar with the concept. Through online sources and lecture notes, we overcame this by gaining a better understanding of mock objects and their importance in testing environments where dependencies are involved.


Boundary Test Cases: Designing effective boundary test cases for methods like getLength() and expand() in the Range class was challenging. We learned to apply boundary analysis more effectively, ensuring we covered all edge cases.


Collaboration and Merge Conflicts: Working in a team environment, especially remotely, presented challenges with merge conflicts in Git. We learned to communicate more effectively, plan our commitments better, and resolve conflicts promptly, enhancing our vision control skills.


Time Management: Balancing this assignment with other coursework was a challenge. We learned to prioritise tasks, set realistic deadlines, and support each other to manage our workload better.

Discussion on what we feel are the benefits and drawbacks of using mocking:

Benefits:

Allows for isolation unit tests from its dependencies, such as ‘Values2D’ which can be tested independently without relying on the actual implementation of ‘Values2D’.
 Mocking can also be used for controlled behaviours, allowing us to specify exactly how we want them to behave during the test. This allows us to simulate different scenarios and error conditions which ensures thorough testing.

Drawbacks:

Mocking is harder to implement than if you just use the data type on its own. 
Since mock objects only simulate the behaviour of real components, there’s a risk that the tests may not accurately reflect the behaviour of the actual system.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The lab provided us with a general introduction to unit testing using the JUnit framework. It was well-structured, guiding us through the project set up including linking dependencies for JFreeChart and JMock. It then guided us through basic unit test examples (with JMock implementation) for each of the classes being considered before moving on to the tests we would write ourselves. 

We found that this exercise was useful. However, we suggest including more examples of more complex scenarios and perhaps a session on advanced JUnit features. Additionally, more guidance on best practices for team collaboration on testing projects could enhance learning outcomes.
